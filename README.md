# Console_Temperature_Monitor
 This code demonstrates an example of creating a Windows Forms application to monitor computer hardware data, specifically GPU information. It utilizes the OpenHardwareMonitor library to obtain GPU temperature and activity data, as well as System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting to display charts.
This code represents part of a program designed to monitor the temperature and activity of a computer's GPU. Let's discuss its key elements:

Form and Component Initialization:

A Form named Form1 is created within the ConsoleTemperatureMonitor namespace.
The constructor of the form initializes various components, such as a Computer object, a Chart component, and a ComboBox.
Component Initialization Methods:

InitializeComputer(): Initializes a Computer object for monitoring hardware data.
InitializeChart(): Configures a Chart component to display GPU activity.
InitializeCustomComboBox(): Initializes a customized ComboBox for selecting activity modes.
Data Update:

Timer1_Tick(): Event handler for the timer event that updates GPU temperature and activity data.
UpdateTemperature(): Updates GPU temperature data and displays it in a RichTextBox.
UpdateChart(): Updates a Chart with GPU load data.
Form Logic:

Event handlers like comboBoxActivityMode_SelectedIndexChanged and checkBox1_CheckedChanged respond to user actions, such as selecting an activity mode or toggling a checkbox.
Form Closing:

MainForm_FormClosing(): Event handler for the form closing event, which prompts for confirmation before closing and releases resources if necessary.
Working with the GPU:

The OpenHardwareMonitor library is used to monitor GPU data.
Various sensors and properties from the Hardware and Sensor objects are utilized to display GPU temperature and activity information.
This code demonstrates how to create a Windows Forms application to monitor computer hardware data, specifically GPU-related information. It leverages the OpenHardwareMonitor library to obtain GPU temperature and activity data and uses System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting to display charts.
